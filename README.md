This first pair assignment has been done by Yumi Komai and Pol Santal√≥. 
The contribution of every student it has been equal and it can be described as follows:
First of all, we created a Repository in our desktop through the program GitHub. At the same time, we made each other contributors so
we could share and edit the documents that we posted in our Repository folder and in GitHub.
In order to create the R source code files document that access at least two data sets, we created a Markdown document where we entered the 
the code 'plot' plus the name of the dates sets that we were interested to show. Then we covert it in a HTML document and we shared it
in our repository. We also posted it in our GitHub online account through the GitHub program in our computer in order to have it there
posted and make some changes online if needed.
The pair that helped us to finish with the last point of the assignment are Bomi and Takuma. They made a pull request and 
our document was minutely discussed and merged.
Finally, we wrote this highly descriptive README.
